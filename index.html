				<u>SCLERA SEGMENTATION BENCHMARKING COMPETITION 2019</u>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Sclera biometrics have gained significant popularity among emerging ocular traits in the last few years. 
				In order to establish this idea and to evaluate the potential of this trait, various pieces of work have been proposed in the literature, both employing sclera individually and in combination with the iris. 
				In spite of those initiatives, sclera biometrics need to studied more extensively to ascertain their usefulness. Moreover segmentation task of sclera should receive more attention due to pertaining challenges.
				In order to fulfill the above-mentioned aims and to attract the attention/interest of researchers we are planning to host the competition.  
				Moreover, for benchmarking sclera segmentation, three competitions were organized namely SSBC 2015, SSRBC 2016, SSERBC 2017 and SSBC 2018 in conjunction with BTAS 2015, ICB 2016, IJCB 2017 and ICB 2018 respectively. 
				Due to the overwhelming successful completion of SSBC 2015, SSRBC 2016, SSERBC 2017 and SSBC 2018, we plan to organize this proposed competition to benchmark sclera segmentation on both low and high resolution images.
