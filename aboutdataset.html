				<u>ABOUT THE DATASET</u>
			</h1>
			<p>
				The competition aims to benchmark the sclera segmentation task with a dataset containing both low and high resolution images. Two different datasets will be employed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b><u>FIRST DATASET:</u></b> The first one is acquired by DSLR. The first database consists of 2624 RGB images taken from 82 identities and images were collected from both the eyes of each individual so 164 different eyes. Here for each individual image, four multi-angles (looking straight, left, right and up) are considered and for each angle 4 images are considered. The individual comprises of both male and female and different colours, few of them were wearing contact lens and images were taken in different time in the day. The database contains images with blinking eyes, closed eye and blurred eye images. High-resolution images are provided in the database (300 dpi resolution and 7500 x 5000 dimensions). All the images are in JPEG format. A NIKON D 800 camera and 28300 lenses were used for image capturing. A ground truth or manual sclera segmentation of this dataset is prepared. For development purposes, a subset of the database, both eye images and ground truth (1 image for each angle of first 30 individual’s i.e. 120) will be provided to the participants.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b><u>SECOND DATASET:</u></b> The second one is acquired by a mobile camera. This second database consists of 500 RGB images from both eyes of 25 individuals (in other words 50 different eyes). For each eye, 10 sample images were captured. The database contained blurred images and images with blinking eyes. The individuals were comprised of both males and females (12 males and 13 females), of different ages and different skin colours, 2 of them were wearing contact lenses and the images were taken at different times of the day. Variation in image quality (blur, lighting condition etc.) and different acquisition conditions was included intentionally in the database to investigate the performance of the framework in non-ideal scenarios. High-resolution images (3264 × 2448) of 96 dpi are included in the database. All the images are in JPEG format. The images were captured using a mobile camera with an 8-megapixel rear camera.
